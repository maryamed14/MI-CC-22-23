# nginx and Waitress

As Gunicorn does not support windows, so we can use [waitress](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/waitress/en/latest/)

Waitress is meant to be a production-quality pure-Python WSGI server with very acceptable performance. It has no dependencies except ones which live in the Python standard library. It runs on CPython on Unix and Windows under Python 3.7+. It is also known to run on PyPy 3 (python version 3.7+) on UNIX. It supports HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.

by following steps [here](https://github.com/Johnnyboycurtis/webproject#nginx-and-waitress) we run the app in [nginx and Waitress](https://github.com/Johnnyboycurtis/webproject#nginx-and-waitress)

# justification of the logging used


### logging: This library already comes by default in Python, so there is no need to install anything additional.



by creating a file [logs.py](https://github.com/maryamed14/MI-CC-22-23/blob/main/logs.py) we then test it by run the command python logs.py 


we can see in this image the result
